<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs VIPM and applies all .vipc dependency files found in C:\vipm.
    This script runs INSIDE the Docker build container (Windows Server Core).

    Used to bake third-party VIPM add-ons into the CI image -- e.g. Antidoc
    (wovalab_lib_antidoc_cli), Wovalab's LabVIEW code-documentation generator,
    which is distributed only through VIPM and is the supported way to produce
    project documentation headlessly in CI/CD.

.NOTES
    These values can be overridden at image-build time via environment variables
    so the script does not need editing for each LabVIEW major version:
      LABVIEW_VERSION     LabVIEW year passed to `vipm install`; MUST match the
                          LabVIEW in the NI base image. Default: 2026.
      LABVIEW_BITNESS     LabVIEW bitness passed to `vipm install`. Default: 64.
      VIPM_INSTALLER_URL  VIPM community installer (https://vipm.jki.net) for a
                          VIPM build that supports LABVIEW_VERSION.

    Headless install model: the vipm CLI installs packages in Community Edition
    (no VIPM Pro license needed) -- the script sets VIPM_COMMUNITY_EDITION and
    NO_COLOR for unattended runs (the CLI is non-interactive by default). It also
    launches LabVIEW headless before installing, because vipm requires a running
    LabVIEW or it fails with "IO error: Failed to load". VIPM Pro activation is
    still honored if VIPM_SERIAL_NUMBER / VIPM_FULL_NAME / VIPM_EMAIL are supplied.

# -- 1. Install VIPM if not already present -----------------------------------
# VIPM is normally pre-installed into the image by labview-ci.Dockerfile, which
# downloads the official VIPM 2026 Q3 (26.3.3954) Windows installer from the JKI
# CDN and runs it silently, so this script just finds vipm.exe and applies the
# .vipc. If it is NOT already present we fall back to downloading the same
# installer here ($VipmInstallerUrl, overridable via VIPM_INSTALLER_URL). That
# fallback is OPTIONAL and fetched from a vendor-controlled URL that can move or
# 404 at any time, so a download/install failure must NOT brick the core CI image
# (LabVIEW + VI Analyzer were installed above). Treat the fallback as best-effort:
# on failure, warn and skip the add-ons (exit 0) instead of failing the build.
# Prefer the MODERN vipm CLI (C:\Program Files\JKI\VIPM) over the legacy
# LabVIEW-based CLI (C:\Program Files\JKI\VI Package Manager\...). The modern CLI
# has first-class headless/container support (--refresh, Community Edition mode)
